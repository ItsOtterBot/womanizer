//! Pitch + formant DSP primitives — `Stretch48k`, `SmoothedVoiceParams`, `Gate`, `Yin48k`.
//!
//! Populated by Plan 02-01 as a TYPE-CONTRACT SKELETON. Wave 1 plans (02-04 through 02-07)
//! fill in the bodies; this plan locks every public signature so downstream tasks land
//! against a known surface. Mirrors the Phase 1 `resampler.rs` pattern verbatim — every
//! struct here is constructed OFF the audio thread (during worker spawn or via the
//! off-RT preset-rebuild path) and exposes a single per-block hot-path method callable
//! from inside `assert_no_alloc(|| { ... })` (RESEARCH §Pattern 1).
//!
//! ## What lives here
//! - [`Preset`]: three-variant quality enum (Low / Balanced / Quality) per D-26 + RESEARCH §Q2.
//!   Defined in `womanizer-core::primitives` as of Plan 02-02 (so `EngineCommand::SetPreset(Preset)`
//!   can reference it without a circular crate dep — Pattern G); re-exported here for ergonomic
//!   `use crate::dsp::Preset`. [`preset_window_hop`] returns the STFT `(block_length, interval)`
//!   pair that fits each latency budget. Starting points; execute-time A/B may tighten Quality (D-25).
//! - [`Stretch48k`]: wrapper around `signalsmith_stretch::Stretch` with the preset
//!   stashed. Constructed off-RT; `process(&[f32], &mut [f32])` is the per-block hot path.
//!   `set_transpose(m)` / `set_formant(m)` adopt D-24's locked `compensate_pitch = true` so
//!   callers cannot accidentally disable independent pitch + formant control.
//! - [`SmoothedVoiceParams`]: pure-Rust per-block exponential interpolator (RESEARCH
//!   §Pattern 3 + Example B). 30 ms time-constant per D-35; `step(target_pitch, target_formant)`
//!   is the per-block call between `triple_buffer<VoiceParams>::Output::read()` and the
//!   `Stretch48k::set_transpose` / `set_formant` setters. Without this, slider drags produce
//!   zipper noise (CONTEXT Pitfall #7).
//! - [`Gate`]: RMS gate with hysteresis (open at −45 dBFS, close at −50 dBFS, 50 ms hold-open)
//!   per D-30. `update(raw_input_rms)` returns the gate-open boolean; gate-closed → worker
//!   emits true digital silence (D-29).
//! - [`Yin48k`]: wraps `pitch_detection::detector::yin::YINDetector<f32>` with a 512-sample
//!   window per D-32. `BufferPool` pre-allocated at construction so `get_pitch(&[f32])` is
//!   alloc-free on the hot path (verified against 0.3.0 source, RESEARCH §Q4).
//! - [`rms_simd`]: free function — `wide::f32x8` SIMD RMS over a sample slice. Hot-path
//!   helper for D-34 SIMD acceleration; replaces the scalar `.map(|s| s*s).sum()` in
//!   `cpal_io::capture` and the Gate's per-block RMS read.
//!
//! ## No per-call allocation invariant
//! Every per-block method below performs ONLY:
//! - slice reads / writes against caller-supplied buffers,
//! - stack-local f32 arithmetic against `self`'s preexisting fields,
//! - calls into upstream crates (`signalsmith_stretch::Stretch::process` / setters,
//!   `pitch_detection::YINDetector::get_pitch`, `wide::f32x8` ops) whose docs guarantee
//!   no heap allocation.
//!
//! No `Vec::push`, no `Vec::extend`, no `Vec::with_capacity`, no `Box::new`. The
//! `dsp_assert_no_alloc_loop` integration test (Plan 02-09) verifies the contract under
//! the global `AllocDisabler`.
//!
//! ## Construction discipline
//! All `new()` calls live on the DSP worker spawn path OR on the engine event-loop thread
//! (preset rebuild via `EngineCommand::SetPreset`, Plan 02-08). NEVER inside the worker's
//! `loop { ... }` body, NEVER inside the cpal callback.
