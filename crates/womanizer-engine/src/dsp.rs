//! Pitch + formant DSP primitives — `Stretch48k`, `SmoothedVoiceParams`, `Gate`, `Yin48k`.
//!
//! Populated by Plan 02-01 as a TYPE-CONTRACT SKELETON. Wave 1 plans (02-04 through 02-07)
//! fill in the bodies; this plan locks every public signature so downstream tasks land
//! against a known surface. Mirrors the Phase 1 `resampler.rs` pattern verbatim — every
//! struct here is constructed OFF the audio thread (during worker spawn or via the
//! off-RT preset-rebuild path) and exposes a single per-block hot-path method callable
//! from inside `assert_no_alloc(|| { ... })` (RESEARCH §Pattern 1).
//!
//! ## What lives here
//! - [`Preset`]: three-variant quality enum (Low / Balanced / Quality) per D-26 + RESEARCH §Q2.
//!   Defined in `womanizer-core::primitives` as of Plan 02-02 (so `EngineCommand::SetPreset(Preset)`
//!   can reference it without a circular crate dep — Pattern G); re-exported here for ergonomic
//!   `use crate::dsp::Preset`. [`preset_window_hop`] returns the STFT `(block_length, interval)`
//!   pair that fits each latency budget. Starting points; execute-time A/B may tighten Quality (D-25).
//! - [`Stretch48k`]: wrapper around `signalsmith_stretch::Stretch` with the preset
//!   stashed. Constructed off-RT; `process(&[f32], &mut [f32])` is the per-block hot path.
//!   `set_transpose(m)` / `set_formant(m)` adopt D-24's locked `compensate_pitch = true` so
//!   callers cannot accidentally disable independent pitch + formant control.
//! - [`SmoothedVoiceParams`]: pure-Rust per-block exponential interpolator (RESEARCH
//!   §Pattern 3 + Example B). 30 ms time-constant per D-35; widened by Plan 03-01 from 2
//!   smoothed fields (pitch, formant) to 6 — adds breath, brightness_db, sibilance, mix —
//!   all sharing a single `alpha` coefficient at the D-35 tau. `step(targets...)` is the
//!   per-block call between `triple_buffer<VoiceParams>::Output::read()` and the per-stage
//!   setters/inputs. Without this, slider drags produce zipper noise (CONTEXT Pitfall #7).
//! - [`BiquadDF1`]: shared Direct-Form-I biquad per RBJ Audio EQ Cookbook
//!   (w3.org/TR/audio-eq-cookbook/). Constructed off-RT; `set_high_shelf` / `set_bandpass`
//!   / `set_peaking` recompute coefficients off the per-sample loop (once per block from
//!   smoothed slider values is the downstream Plan 03-02/03 pattern); per-sample `step()`
//!   runs inside `assert_no_alloc(|| { ... })`. Used by the Phase 3 DeEsser, BrightnessShelf,
//!   and Breathiness stages — landed here by Plan 03-01 so downstream plans share a single
//!   coefficient-math source.
//! - [`BrightnessShelf`]: SHAPE-02 — RBJ second-order high-shelf at 4000 Hz / Q=0.707.
//!   Per-block coefficient recompute from smoothed gain_db; D-42 warm-off; D-44 default
//!   +3 dB. Landed by Plan 03-02; wraps a single [`BiquadDF1`].
//! - [`DeEsser`]: SHAPE-03 — split-band compressor at 6500 Hz / Q=1.0; soft-knee 6 dB
//!   width, threshold −24 dBFS, 1 ms attack / 50 ms release per-sample envelope follower.
//!   D-42 warm-off; D-46 default 0.30. Landed by Plan 03-02; wraps two [`BiquadDF1`] bands
//!   (detector + extract) with independent state.
//! - [`Gate`]: RMS gate with hysteresis (open at −45 dBFS, close at −50 dBFS, 50 ms hold-open)
//!   per D-30. `update(raw_input_rms)` returns the gate-open boolean; gate-closed → worker
//!   emits true digital silence (D-29).
//! - [`Yin48k`]: wraps `pitch_detection::detector::yin::YINDetector<f32>` with a 512-sample
//!   window per D-32. `BufferPool` pre-allocated at construction so `get_pitch(&[f32])` is
//!   alloc-free on the hot path (verified against 0.3.0 source, RESEARCH §Q4).
//! - [`rms_simd`]: free function — `wide::f32x8` SIMD RMS over a sample slice. Hot-path
//!   helper for D-34 SIMD acceleration; replaces the scalar `.map(|s| s*s).sum()` in
//!   `cpal_io::capture` and the Gate's per-block RMS read.
//!
//! ## No per-call allocation invariant
//! Every per-block method below performs ONLY:
//! - slice reads / writes against caller-supplied buffers,
//! - stack-local f32 arithmetic against `self`'s preexisting fields,
//! - calls into upstream crates (`signalsmith_stretch::Stretch::process` / setters,
//!   `pitch_detection::YINDetector::get_pitch`, `wide::f32x8` ops) whose docs guarantee
//!   no heap allocation.
//!
//! No `Vec::push`, no `Vec::extend`, no `Vec::with_capacity`, no `Box::new`. The
//! `dsp_assert_no_alloc_loop` integration test (Plan 02-09) verifies the contract under
//! the global `AllocDisabler`.
//!
//! ## Construction discipline
//! All `new()` calls live on the DSP worker spawn path OR on the engine event-loop thread
//! (preset rebuild via `EngineCommand::SetPreset`, Plan 02-08). NEVER inside the worker's
//! `loop { ... }` body, NEVER inside the cpal callback.

///
/// The RESEARCH §Q2 starting points (1024/256, 2048/512, 3072/768) were derived from the
/// optimistic assumption that `input_latency() + output_latency() ≈ block_length / 2`.

/// analysis window; the sum is the full block_length). The original windows therefore
/// would have produced 21.33 / 42.67 / 64.00 ms Stretch latency — Balanced and Quality
/// blow their D-25 round-trip budgets even before the cpal capture+playback in-flight
/// overhead is added.
///
/// Plan 02-09 tightens the windows per RESEARCH §Q2 step 4 ("If the largest window for
/// a given budget already saturates the budget, the planner stays with the starting-point
/// above and notes it" — except the starting points don't fit; tightening is the
/// alternative):
///
/// | Preset   | Window | Hop | Stretch latency | D-25 round-trip budget | Stretch budget |
/// |----------|--------|-----|-----------------|------------------------|----------------|
/// | Low      | 768    | 192 | 16.00 ms        | <32 ms                 | <19.3 ms       |
/// | Balanced | 1024   | 256 | 21.33 ms        | <40 ms                 | <27.3 ms       |
/// | Quality  | 1536   | 384 | 32.00 ms        | <50 ms                 | <37.3 ms       |
///
/// The Stretch budget is `total_budget − 12.7 ms` (RESEARCH §Q2 platform-overhead estimate
/// for cpal capture+playback in-flight + scheduling slack). All three presets now leave
/// 3–5 ms of headroom against their respective Stretch budgets. The
/// `dsp_preset_latency_budget` integration test (Plan 02-09 Task 2) verifies the
/// construction-time latency stays in budget; the manual checkpoint (Plan 02-09 Task 3)
/// verifies the live `Telemetry::latency_ms` stays in budget per preset against the actual
/// measured platform overhead.

///   `len.max(1)`, sqrt.
///
/// ## Allocation profile
/// `f32x8` is a `#[repr(C)]` value type; all loads / arithmetic happen on stack. No
/// `Vec::push`, no `Box::new`, no heap. Safe to call inside `assert_no_alloc(|| { ... })`
